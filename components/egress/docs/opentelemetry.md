# OpenTelemetry Metrics (Current Egress Support)

This page lists the OpenTelemetry metrics currently implemented in egress.

## Metrics

| Metric | Type | Unit | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `egress.dns.query.duration` | Histogram | `s` | Upstream DNS forward latency (recorded for allowed queries). |
| `egress.dns.query.failed_total` | Counter | - | Queries the proxy could not resolve, by `reason`. |
| `egress.policy.denied_total` | Counter | - | Number of DNS queries denied by policy. |
| `egress.nftables.rules.count` | Observable Gauge | `{element}` | Approximate policy size after last successful static apply (fleet profile: summed across every installed subject's policy, 0 while deny-first). |
| `egress.nftables.updates.count` | Counter | - | Number of successful nftables updates (static apply + dynamic IP add). |
| `egress.nftables.updates.failed_total` | Counter | - | nftables updates that failed, by `operation`. |
| `egress.system.memory.usage_bytes` | Observable Gauge | `By` | System memory used bytes (Linux: gopsutil; non-Linux build: `0`). |
| `egress.system.cpu.utilization` | Observable Gauge | `1` | CPU busy ratio in `[0,1]` (Linux: gopsutil; non-Linux build: `0`). |

`egress.dns.query.duration` declares its bucket boundaries explicitly:

```
0.001  0.0025  0.005  0.01  0.025  0.05  0.1  0.25  0.5  1  2.5  5  10  15  30  60  120  300  600
```

Do not drop them: the instrument records **seconds**, while the SDK default boundaries are
the spec's millisecond ladder (`0, 5, 10, … 10000`), so every realistic latency would fall
into the single `le=5` bucket and the quantiles would be meaningless.

The head resolves a cache hit (sub-millisecond) up to one upstream timeout
(`OPENSANDBOX_EGRESS_DNS_UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT`, 5s by default). The coarse tail exists because
the recorded duration covers the **whole resolver chain**: forwarding walks the upstreams
serially, each with the full timeout, so a query can legitimately take
`timeout x len(upstreams)` — 15s is three resolvers at the default, and 120s is the cap a
single exchange can be configured to wait. A late **success** lands in the tail too, not only an exhausted failure: a query can
succeed on the second resolver after the first burned a full timeout. The chain has no finite
worst case either (`OPENSANDBOX_EGRESS_DNS_UPSTREAM` accepts an unbounded resolver list), so
past the last boundary quantile resolution is lost by construction and `_count` is what
remains. A configuration that gets there — several resolvers each waiting close to the 120s
per-exchange cap — has bigger problems than a percentile.

Note both successful and failed lookups feed this histogram, so its tail mixes slow
resolutions with exhausted retry chains.

## Failure Signals

`egress.dns.query.failed_total` and `egress.policy.denied_total` answer different
questions, and confusing them inverts the diagnosis:

- **denied** — the policy did its job. The workload asked for something it is not allowed
  to reach. Expected traffic in a working system.
- **failed** — the sidecar could not do its job. The workload asked for something allowed
  and got `SERVFAIL`. Never expected.

`reason` comes from a closed set, so the counter's cardinality is fixed and neither the
queried name nor the error text is ever attached:

| `reason` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `no_upstreams` | No resolvers configured or discovered. |
| `upstream_error` | Every resolver failed to answer (network error, timeout). |
| `empty_response` | A resolver returned a nil message. |
| `rcode` | The last resolver answered with a failover-worthy rcode, e.g. `SERVFAIL`. |

`egress.nftables.updates.failed_total` covers the other silent failure. Its `operation`
attribute is one of `static_apply`, `dynamic_add`, `remove`, or — in the fleet profile
(OSEP-0022) — `deny_first`, `dispatch_update`, `reset`; `dynamic_add` is the one to
alert on, because a failed add means the kernel never learned about IPs the policy allows,
so the chain drops traffic that should pass — which looks exactly like a policy denial from
inside the sandbox while `egress.policy.denied_total` stays flat.

The per-sandbox netns layer (fleet profile) counts its updates under the same operations;
two expected cases are deliberately NOT counted as failures: a sandbox-layer removal whose
netns is already destroyed (the rules died with it), and the startup recovery sweep of
netns that never had a table installed.

A `static_apply` failure happens during startup, where the sidecar logs and exits. Metrics
leave through a periodic reader and `os.Exit` skips the deferred shutdown, so that path
flushes telemetry explicitly before terminating — otherwise the one sample explaining why the
sidecar died would never be exported.

## Shared Attributes

All egress metrics may include shared attributes:

- `sandbox_id` from `OPENSANDBOX_EGRESS_SANDBOX_ID` (when set)
- extra key/value attributes from `OPENSANDBOX_EGRESS_METRICS_EXTRA_ATTRS` (when set)

## OTEL Endpoint Configuration

Metric export is enabled only when at least one OTLP endpoint is set.

- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT` (preferred)
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (fallback)

If both are unset, egress keeps metrics local (no OTLP export).

### Automatic Egress Allow Rule

When an OTLP destination is configured — the endpoint env vars below, or the
exporter fallback node IP (`HOST_IP` / `/etc/hostinfo`) when both are unset —
egress automatically injects an always-allow egress rule for that host
(domain or IP, any port), so telemetry export works under the default deny-all
policy without manually managing allowlist rules. This also covers the egress
sidecar's own metric export, which shares the sandbox network namespace and
would otherwise be blocked by its own egress chain.

- The rule follows the standard precedence: `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT`
  wins over `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`; the fallback node IP applies only
  when neither is set. A set-but-invalid endpoint never falls back (the
  exporter does not either), so no rule is injected in that case.
- The endpoint must be a URL (`https://host:4318/v1/metrics`) — the
  `otlpmetrichttp` env-var form. Bare `host:port` or `host` values are not
  accepted (the exporter parses them as opaque URLs with an empty host); a
  trailing root dot on FQDNs is trimmed to match DNS policy normalization.
- The rule lives in the always-allow layer: it survives user `POST`/`PATCH`/`DELETE`
  policy updates and always-rule file reloads. Operators can still block the target
  with `deny.always`, which takes precedence.
- Rules are host-scoped (any port), matching the egress rule model; ports are not
  enforced per rule.

> **Note**: use a fully-qualified service name or an IP in the endpoint.
> Single-label names (e.g. `otel-collector`) are subject to resolver
> search-domain expansion, and the deny-all DNS proxy answers the expanded
> names (e.g. `otel-collector.<ns>.svc.cluster.local`) with NXDOMAIN without
> falling back to the bare name, so the auto-generated exact-host allow rule
> would not be reached.

### Minimal Example

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT="http://otel-collector.sandbox.svc.cluster.local:4318"
```

An IP endpoint works as well:

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT="http://10.0.0.5:4318"
```

### Service Name

`service.name` is set by egress code as `opensandbox-egress-<version>`.

## Structured logs (JSON)

Egress structured logs are emitted by zap (typically to stdout). OTLP log export is not implemented in-tree.

### Common fields

- `sandbox_id` is included when `OPENSANDBOX_EGRESS_SANDBOX_ID` is set.
- key/value pairs from `OPENSANDBOX_EGRESS_METRICS_EXTRA_ATTRS` are merged into the root logger.
- `opensandbox.event` identifies the event family.

### Outbound DNS logs

- `opensandbox.event=egress.outbound`
- emitted on allow-path DNS handling (success or forward error)
- common payload keys:
  - `target.host` (normalized query name)
  - `target.ips` (resolved A/AAAA addresses, when present)
  - `peer` (IP-only destination path)
  - `error` (forward failure message)

### Policy lifecycle logs

- `opensandbox.event=egress.loaded` (initial effective policy loaded)
- `opensandbox.event=egress.updated` (policy update applied)
- `opensandbox.event=egress.update_failed` (policy update failed)

Common policy fields:

- `egress.default` (`allow` / `deny`)
- `rules` (rule summary; for `egress.updated`, reflects current request body semantics)
- `error` (present for `egress.update_failed`)
