description: Secure credential injection for sandbox outbound requests without exposing secrets to workloads.

# Credential Vault

Credential Vault is OpenSandbox's outbound credential broker for sandboxed agents and developer tools. Real credentials are written to the egress sidecar by the host-side SDK, while the sandbox process only receives fake or empty credential values. When tools such as Claude Code, Git, curl, package managers, or model API clients make allowed outbound HTTPS requests, the sidecar matches the request against Credential Vault bindings and injects the required authentication headers on the way out. This lets existing tools keep their normal workflows while keeping real secrets out of the sandbox environment, command line, filesystem, and logs, reducing credential exfiltration risk from prompt injection or untrusted code.

## Requirements

- `opensandbox-server` >= 0.2.0
- `egress` >= 1.1.1
- Python SDK >= 0.1.11
- JavaScript/TypeScript SDK >= 0.1.9
- Kotlin SDK >= 1.0.13
- Go SDK >= 1.0.3
- C# SDK >= 0.1.3
- Server config sets `[egress].image`.
- Server config sets `[egress].mode = "dns+nft"`. Credential Vault refuses to
  activate in DNS-only mode because direct-IP connections can bypass DNS policy.
- Sandbox create request includes an outbound network policy.
- The outbound network policy should use `defaultAction="deny"` and explicitly
  allow every host referenced by a credential binding. Default-allow remains
  temporarily supported for backward compatibility but emits a security warning.
- Sandbox create request enables Credential Proxy.
- Sandbox pods are not running with an additional transparent service-mesh sidecar (for example Istio/Envoy injection) in the same network namespace. Credential Vault currently assumes the OpenSandbox egress sidecar is the only transparent outbound interception layer in the pod.
- The sandbox image has the tools you want to run. For Claude Code, use an image
  with Node.js and npm, such as the OpenSandbox code-interpreter image.

::: warning Migration notice
Credential Proxy still requires server `[egress].mode = "dns+nft"`; deployments
that cannot provide nft enforcement cannot safely enable credential injection.
Default-allow policies remain accepted during the compatibility period, but emit
a security warning and should migrate to `defaultAction="deny"` before enforcement
is tightened in a future release.

## How It Works

![Credential Vault request flow](../public/images/credential-vault.png)

Credential Vault is implemented by the egress sidecar. A sandbox must be created
with both an outbound `network_policy` / `networkPolicy` and Credential Proxy
enabled. The lifecycle API field name is `credentialProxy.enabled`; SDKs expose
that field using their language-specific naming conventions.

At a high level:

1. The lifecycle server attaches the egress sidecar to the sandbox.
2. The SDK writes credentials and bindings to the sidecar Credential Vault API.
3. The sandbox process runs with fake or empty credential environment variables.
4. When the sandbox makes an HTTPS request, transparent MITM in the sidecar
   inspects the request metadata.
5. If exactly one binding matches the request scheme, host, port, method, and
   path, the sidecar injects the configured auth header and scoped placeholder
   substitutions.
6. Secret values are redacted from vault responses and response headers.

Requests that do not match any credential binding are forwarded unchanged.
Credential path-safety checks apply only after a binding matches and the request
would otherwise receive credentials.

The active vault used by the MITM process is served over a local Unix domain
socket inside the sidecar. The sandbox workload cannot fetch this active state
over the normal server proxy path.

## Persistence Across Pause and Resume

::: warning In-memory state
Credential Vault entries are process-local memory in the egress sidecar; they
are not part of the sandbox root filesystem or the `BatchSandbox` Pod template.
Kubernetes pause deletes the Pod after snapshotting, so the fresh egress
sidecar created by resume starts with an empty vault. Credential injection does
not resume until a trusted client creates the credentials and bindings again.

Keep the original vault request or an equivalent secret-manager reference in a
trusted control plane outside the sandbox. After the sandbox returns to
`Running`, call the Credential Vault create API again before allowing work that
depends on those credentials. Do not persist real credential values in sandbox
metadata, environment variables, snapshots, or logs.

Docker pause/unpause retains the existing container processes, but any egress
sidecar replacement or restart also creates a new in-memory vault and requires
the same re-injection procedure.
:::

## Service Mesh Compatibility

Credential Vault depends on the egress sidecar's transparent redirect and MITM path. If the sandbox pod is also injected with a transparent service-mesh sidecar such as Istio/Envoy, both layers will try to intercept outbound traffic in the same network namespace. OpenSandbox does not currently support that combination for Credential Vault.

Use one of these operator patterns instead:

- disable mesh sidecar injection for sandbox pods that need Credential Vault
- keep mesh injection enabled, but do not enable `credentialProxy` / Credential Vault for those pods
- move outbound policy and credential handling to a platform mechanism outside the sandbox pod if mesh injection is mandatory

For the underlying egress-sidecar limitation, see [Egress](/components/egress#service-mesh-compatibility).

Credential bindings are intentionally precise. A default-deny egress policy is
required. Use a narrow path match, for example `/v1/*` for Anthropic API calls.

## Auth Types

Each binding uses an `auth` rule to describe how the referenced credential is
rendered into the outbound request:

- `bearer`: injects `Authorization: Bearer <credential>`.
- `basic`: injects `Authorization: Basic <credential>`. The credential value
  must already be base64-encoded `username:password`.
- `apiKey`: injects the credential value into the configured header name.
- `customHeaders`: injects multiple configured headers, each backed by its own
  credential.
- `passthrough`: does not inject an auth header. Use it with `substitutions`
  when the upstream API requires a credential in a path, query string, or body
  placeholder instead of a header.

Simple examples:

```python
auth={"type": "bearer", "credential": "github-token"}
```

```http
Authorization: Bearer <github-token>
```

```python
auth={"type": "basic", "credential": "registry-basic"}
```

```http
Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>
```

```python
auth={"type": "apiKey", "name": "x-api-key", "credential": "anthropic-api-key"}
```

```http
x-api-key: <anthropic-api-key>
```

```python
auth={
    "type": "customHeaders",
    "headers": [
        {"name": "X-Client-Id", "credential": "client-id"},
        {"name": "X-Client-Secret", "credential": "client-secret"},
    ],
}
```

```http
X-Client-Id: <client-id>
X-Client-Secret: <client-secret>
```

### Scoped Placeholder Substitutions

Some upstream APIs require credentials in a request URL or body instead of a
dedicated auth header. Credential Vault can handle those APIs without placing the
real credential in the sandbox process. All auth types accept an optional
`substitutions` list. Each substitution names a credential, a literal
placeholder, and the request surfaces where replacement is allowed:

```python
auth={
    "type": "passthrough",
    "substitutions": [
        {
            "credential": "client-secret",
            "placeholder": "__client_secret__",
            "in": ["body", "query"],
        }
    ],
}
```

Use `type="passthrough"` when the binding only performs substitutions and should
not inject an auth header. You can also combine substitutions with `bearer`,
`basic`, `apiKey`, or `customHeaders` when the same upstream request needs both
header injection and placeholder replacement.

Substitution is disabled by default and is exact, literal, and case-sensitive.
Only the configured surfaces are rewritten:

| Surface | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `path` | Replaces placeholders in the request path and URL-encodes the credential value. If the rewritten path contains ambiguous path segments, encoded separators, or traversal-like content, the sidecar rejects the request instead of forwarding a secret-bearing URL outside the matched scope. |
| `query` | Replaces placeholders in the query string and URL-encodes the credential value. |
| `header` | Replaces placeholders in the original request headers, excluding hop-by-hop and security-sensitive headers such as `Host`, `Content-Length`, and forwarding headers. Substitutions run before Credential Vault injects auth headers, so the sidecar does not rewrite the credential headers it creates. |
| `body` | Replaces placeholders in UTF-8 request bodies. For `application/json`, the replacement is encoded as JSON string contents, so put the placeholder inside a quoted JSON string. For `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, the replacement is form-encoded. Compressed and multipart bodies are skipped. |

The sidecar applies all replacements for a surface against the original request
text in one pass. Inserted credential values are not scanned again for later
placeholders, which prevents one secret from accidentally rewriting another
secret. When a body is rewritten, the sidecar updates `Content-Length` and
removes `Transfer-Encoding` because the forwarded request now has a fixed-size
buffered body.

The placeholder, raw credential value, URL-encoded value, form-encoded value,
and JSON-escaped values are added to the active redaction set. A binding with
substitutions that matched the request but did not find any placeholder emits a
substitution-miss log without exposing credential values.

Example configuration:

```python
await sandbox.credential_vault.create(
    credentials=[
        Credential(name="tenant-id", source={"value": "tenant 42"}),
        Credential(name="api-key", source={"value": "query secret+value"}),
        Credential(name="client-secret", source={"value": 'body "secret" value'}),
    ],
    bindings=[
        CredentialBinding(
            name="token-request",
            match={
                "schemes": ["https"],
                "hosts": ["api.example.com"],
                "methods": ["POST"],
                "paths": ["/tenants/__tenant_id__/token"],
            },
            auth={
                "type": "passthrough",
                "substitutions": [
                    {
                        "credential": "tenant-id",
                        "placeholder": "__tenant_id__",
                        "in": ["path"],
                    },
                    {
                        "credential": "api-key",
                        "placeholder": "__api_key__",
                        "in": ["query"],
                    },
                    {
                        "credential": "client-secret",
                        "placeholder": "__client_secret__",
                        "in": ["body"],
                    },
                ],
            },
        )
    ],
)
```

The sandbox can use placeholders instead of real secrets:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "https://api.example.com/tenants/__tenant_id__/token?api_key=__api_key__" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  --data '{"client_secret":"__client_secret__"}'
```

The upstream receives the rewritten request:

```http
POST /tenants/tenant%2042/token?api_key=query%20secret%2Bvalue HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/json

{"client_secret":"body \"secret\" value"}
```

## Egress Sidecar Configuration

| Environment variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENSANDBOX_EGRESS_CREDENTIAL_VAULT_REQUIRE_TLS` | off | When enabled (`true`/`1`/`on`), credential vault write operations (create, patch, delete) require TLS, loopback transport, or `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` from a configured trusted proxy. When disabled (default), any authenticated request is accepted regardless of transport. Enable this in deployments where the egress sidecar is directly reachable from untrusted networks without a TLS-terminating reverse proxy. |
| `OPENSANDBOX_EGRESS_CREDENTIAL_VAULT_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` | empty | Comma-separated IP addresses or CIDRs allowed to assert `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`. Forwarded transport headers from all other peers are ignored. Configure this when TLS terminates at a reverse proxy before the egress sidecar. |


## SDK Quick Reference

All sandbox SDKs use the same wire contract. The main differences are naming and
language style:

| SDK | Enable proxy on sandbox create | Vault entry point | Create / patch methods |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Python | `credential_proxy=CredentialProxyConfig(enabled=True)` | `sandbox.credential_vault` | `create(...)`, `patch(...)` |
| Go | `CredentialProxy: &opensandbox.CredentialProxyConfig{Enabled: true}` | `sandbox.CredentialVault(ctx)` or sandbox helpers | `CreateCredentialVault(ctx, req)`, `PatchCredentialVault(ctx, req)` |
| JavaScript/TypeScript | `credentialProxy: { enabled: true }` | `sandbox.credentialVault` | `create(request)`, `patch(request)` |
| Kotlin/JVM | `.credentialProxyEnabled(true)` or `.credentialProxy { enabled(true) }` | `sandbox.credentialVault()` | `create(request)`, `patch(request)` |
| C#/.NET | `CredentialProxy = new CredentialProxyConfig { Enabled = true }` | `sandbox.CredentialVault` or sandbox helpers | `CreateCredentialVaultAsync(...)`, `PatchCredentialVaultAsync(...)` |

The vault APIs return sanitized metadata. Plaintext credential values are
write-only and are not returned by `get`, `list`, or patch responses.

## Claude Code With Anthropic

This example installs Claude Code in the sandbox and calls the official
Anthropic API endpoint. The real API key is read on the host and written to
Credential Vault. The sandbox only sees a fake `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

Before running the script:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
# Optional: export ANTHROPIC_MODEL="<a Claude Code supported Anthropic model>"
```

Run:

```python
import os
from datetime import timedelta

from opensandbox import SandboxSync
from opensandbox.models.sandboxes import (
    Credential,
    CredentialBinding,
    CredentialProxyConfig,
    NetworkPolicy,
    NetworkRule,
    SandboxImageSpec,
)


ANTHROPIC_HOST = "api.anthropic.com"
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL = "https://api.anthropic.com"
REAL_API_KEY = os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"]


sandbox_env = {
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL,
    "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "fake-key-inside-sandbox",
}
if os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_MODEL"):
    sandbox_env["ANTHROPIC_MODEL"] = os.environ["ANTHROPIC_MODEL"]


sandbox = SandboxSync.create(
    image=SandboxImageSpec(
        os.getenv("SANDBOX_IMAGE", "opensandbox/code-interpreter:latest")
    ),
    timeout=timedelta(minutes=15),
    env=sandbox_env,
    network_policy=NetworkPolicy(
        defaultAction="deny",
        egress=[
            NetworkRule(action="allow", target=ANTHROPIC_HOST),
            NetworkRule(action="allow", target="registry.npmjs.org"),
        ],
    ),
    credential_proxy=CredentialProxyConfig(enabled=True),
)

try:
    sandbox.credential_vault.create(
        credentials=[
            Credential(
                name="anthropic-api-key",
                source={"value": REAL_API_KEY},
            )
        ],
        bindings=[
            CredentialBinding(
                name="anthropic-api",
                match={
                    "schemes": ["https"],
                    "hosts": [ANTHROPIC_HOST],
                    "methods": ["GET", "POST"],
                    "paths": ["/v1/*"],
                },
                auth={
                    "type": "apiKey",
                    "name": "x-api-key",
                    "credential": "anthropic-api-key",
                },
            )
        ],
    )

    sandbox.commands.run(
        "npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code --no-audit --no-fund"
    )
    result = sandbox.commands.run("claude -p '1+1'")
    output = "".join(part.text for part in result.logs.stdout)
    print(output)
finally:
    sandbox.kill()
    sandbox.close()
```

The Claude Code process reads the fake key from `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, but the
outbound HTTPS request to `api.anthropic.com/v1/*` receives the real `x-api-key`
header from Credential Vault. If your environment uses a private npm mirror,
replace `registry.npmjs.org` in the network policy and the `npm install`
command with that mirror host.

## Git And Curl With Vault-Injected Credentials

Credential Vault can also protect credentials used by command-line tools such as
`git` and `curl`. Keep the command free of real secrets and bind the request
shape to the credential in Vault instead.

For a private Git repository, store a base64-encoded `username:token` value and
bind it with `basic` auth:

```python
Credential(name="git-basic", source={"value": "<base64(username:token)>"})

CredentialBinding(
    name="git-basic",
    match={
        "schemes": ["https"],
        "hosts": ["git.example.com"],
        "paths": ["/org/private-repo.git*"],
    },
    auth={"type": "basic", "credential": "git-basic"},
)
```

Then run the normal URL without embedding credentials:

```bash
GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 git clone https://git.example.com/org/private-repo.git
```

For an API request that expects a token header, bind the path and method to an
`apiKey` auth rule:

```python
Credential(name="api-token", source={"value": "<token>"})

CredentialBinding(
    name="api-token",
    match={
        "schemes": ["https"],
        "hosts": ["api.example.com"],
        "methods": ["GET"],
        "paths": ["/v1/projects/123/variables"],
    },
    auth={"type": "apiKey", "name": "PRIVATE-TOKEN", "credential": "api-token"},
)
```

The sandbox command stays secret-free:

```bash
curl -fsS https://api.example.com/v1/projects/123/variables
```

## Binding Guidance

- Use `defaultAction="deny"` and only allow the service hosts required by the
  tool. Default-allow policies are deprecated because they may allow credential
  destination bypass and will emit a security warning.
- Scope bindings by path whenever possible, for example `/v1/*`.
- Avoid overlapping bindings at the same precedence; ambiguous matches are
  rejected.
- Rejected requests (ambiguous paths, encoded separators crossing a binding
  boundary) return `403` when the request body is small and fully known.
  Requests with bodies above the mitmproxy streaming threshold (~1 MiB) or
  with unknown length (chunked) cannot be answered with a `403` while the
  body is being streamed, so the sidecar drops the connection instead —
  either way the request is never forwarded upstream.
- Do not put real secrets in sandbox `env`, command arguments, files, or
  metadata.
- Keep fake environment variables when a CLI refuses to start without a key; the
  vault-injected header is what authenticates the outbound request.

## Migrating From `ports`

The `match.ports` field is deprecated. Port is now derived from scheme (`https`→443, `http`→80). Only ports 80 and 443 are supported; non-standard values are rejected with a validation error.

If you have existing bindings that use `ports` to narrow scope, migrate them to the equivalent `schemes` restriction:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `schemes: ["http", "https"], ports: [443]` | `schemes: ["https"]` |
| `schemes: ["http", "https"], ports: [80]` | `schemes: ["http"]` |
| `schemes: ["https"], ports: [443]` | `schemes: ["https"]` (remove `ports`) |
